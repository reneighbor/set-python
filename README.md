# set-python
Writing a set from scatch in Python

## Description
A set in a data structure; it is a collection of items. It can be thought of as like a list; however, as disctinct from a list, items in a set must be *unique*. If you have a set that consists of 'Jane', 'Janice', and 'John', you cannot do the operation append the name 'John' to the set, but you can append the name 'Lucy.'

Additionally, items in a set are not typically kept in any sort order, so if you put items into a set in some particular way, you cannot rely on being able to acces or retrieve them according to that order.

The task is to implement a set in Python, but not using the `set` data type.
